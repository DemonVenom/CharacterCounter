# CharacterCounter

⦁	Counting characters in files: implement a program that counts the number of characters, words, and lines in a file. Prompt the user for the name of the file. Use the FileReader class (see its reference page and that of its parent class: InputStreamReader) to open and read the file one character at a time (note that the read( ) method does NOT throw an EOFException; the read returns a -1 when the EOF is encountered). Catch all throwable exceptions. To count the number of lines, simply count the number of occurrences of ‘\n’ read. To count the number of words, count the number of character sequences delimited by whitespace characters (this is a little tricky as there can be multiple whitespace characters between words!). A whitespace character is one the following: ‘ ‘ (space), ‘\t’ (tab), ‘\r’ (carriage return), ‘\n’ (line feed), or ‘\f’ (form feed). Provide a driver in a separate source file to test your class. Taking shortcuts will be penalized
